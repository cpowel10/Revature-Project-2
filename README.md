# Revature-Project-1
### Created by Chris Powell
## Description:
This is my Revature Devops Project 1,
which is the backend implementation of a shopping application, where a user can register, login and
logout of their account, view what items are currently instock, view their cart contents and total
price, add an item to their cart, and either checkout and see the total they were charged or 
empty their cart without being charged. ADMIN users can also add new items to the available stock,
update the item information, or delete items from the database.
## Features Implemented:
1. **Register:** Creates a new row in the User table from data provided by the user
2. **Login:** Login as a user by providing the appropriate username and password

cart contents. Only usable by users with the Role ADMIN

getting updated.
6. **Get current logged in user and their cart:** Get the name and cart contents of 
current logged in user. Must be logged in as user whose info is being accessed 
7. **Add product to cart:** Add a product to the current user's cart. and removes that
item from the available items instock.
8. **Delete users:** Delete current logged in user.
9. **Get all items in stock:** Prints all items currently instock
10. **Checkout:** Proceeds to remove the items from the current user's cart,
and deletes the items from the item table. User must have a credit card number
on their account to checkout.
11. **Empty Cart:** Empties current user's cart without charging them and makes the items 
available for other users to add to their carts
